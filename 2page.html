    <div class="qwe">
      <h2 >You’re in your “Ram-tough” element this week thanks to a tense square between your ruler, fearless Mars, in your truth-telling ninth house and intuitive Neptune on Tuesday, January 11. And that’s a good thing because Neptune has a funny way of making us doubt our senses, even when we KNOW what we’re experiencing. Stay strong in your convictions. If someone tries to pull a fast one or smooth-talk their way out of (or into) something, don’t take the bait! The only thing to stay mindful of is that in sticking to your position, you might lose a little sensitivity or compassion in the process. There IS a happy medium, but it can be harder to find when you feel pulled between opposing poles. And making it just a tiny bit trickier is the fact that nebulous Neptune can fog up your focus and cloud your judgment (while keeping you happily distracted in your private inner world). But if you know this is going in, you can avoid confrontations by letting people maintain their point of view while you do the same. At the same time, cut yourself some slack and throw yourself into more creative, even spiritual, pursuits.</h2>

      <h2>This Friday, communicator Mercury kicks off its first retrograde of the year. The “fun” begins in Aquarius and your eleventh house of tech and teamwork, giving you a chance to reconsider the people you call friends and associates until January 25. From there, the little messenger planet will backflip into Capricorn and your professional tenth house, staying in reverse gear until February 3. Especially when Mercury is amuck in your eleventh house, take extra care to back up important documents, avoid signing anything irrevocable, and double-check all plans and appointments. But there are upsides to retrogrades, too! It’s a great (and rare) opportunity to rethink your strategy for getting ahead: Is your timeline realistic? Do you have all the necessary resources? Don’t rely on guesswork; you need a mapped-out plan and budget! And when Mercury dips back into your career corner on January 25, watch for conflicts with management. As an Aries, you’re no fan of authority figures, but don’t play hero while Mercury is off course. That said, if someone makes a power grab, call them on it. Your competitive spirit will come in handy, but unleash it sparingly..</h2>
